# ScriptedPrimoSearchAssessmentTool
SPST is a tool to read a file of search string to execute searches against the BU Primo servers (production and staging), and record data about the results that are returned. The tool is being developed to enable the Libraries in:
* Assessing the impact of activating particular Primo Central Index collections on the user search experience
* Identifying problems with deduping and FRBRizing
* Assessing issues in known item searching

We are beginning to move this master branch to be a more stable version that can be used to build out use cases. Development is being done on a fork at: https://github.com/jwacooks/ScriptedPrimoSearchAssessmentTool . As they become stable, those changes will be integrated into this version.
