# ScriptedPrimoSearchAssessmentTool
### version 1.01

##Purpose:
SPST is a tool to automated searching Ex Libris Primo using a set of search strings for the purpose of comparison and analysis. Originally conceived as a tool to automate efforts to compare the impact of activating various collections in Primo Central Index, the number of use cases has begun to grow. The core functionality of SPST is to iterate through a list of search strings, sending a Deep Link Query to Primo, returning the results in a Pandas dataframe.


##Classes
Two classes are included:

SPST: has several functions that do that searching

* 	set_platform_scope
* 	set_search_strings
* 	set_params
* 	build_url
* 	parse_response
* 	parse_facets (havenâ€™t done much with this yet)
* 	data (performs the searches)

CompResults: has functions that do the comparison and analysis (only one so far)

* Compare2ResultSets

##Documentation
SPST is still being developed and documentation is rather sparse. The SPST_Demo.ipynb python notebook provides examples that will hopefully assist in getting started. 

##Installation

pip install git+https://github.com/jwacooks/ScriptedPrimoSearchAssessmentTool.git
